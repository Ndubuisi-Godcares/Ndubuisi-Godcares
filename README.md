These three slogans drive and inspire me in everything I do.<br/>
**"Dream big, work hard, and make it happen."** <br/>
**"Opportunities are intertwined with risks; I choose to embrace the risk and pursue it all."** <br/> 
**"It all comes with great sacrifice, but the rewards are worth the effort."** <br/>
